About: 
  In this repository, I focus on demonstrating the evolution of problem-solving strategies. Each algorithm is presented in two parts:
    1. Brute-force Solutions: These implementations are straightforward and easy to understand, laying the groundwork for more complex approaches.
    2. Optimized Solutions: These refined implementations aim to enhance efficiency, reducing time and space complexity while maintaining correctness.

Problem-Solving Approaches: 
  Brute-Force: Simple and intuitive solutions that may not always be efficient but are easy to grasp.
  Optimized: Solutions that leverage algorithms and data structures to improve performance, showcasing the growth in problem-solving skills.

Code Explanation: 
  Each solution is accompanied by detailed explanations to enhance understanding. This includes:

Intuition: 
  A brief overview of the problem and the thought process behind the solution, explaining why certain methods or techniques were chosen.

Approach:
  A step-by-step outline of the implemented solution, detailing how the code works and what each part does.

Complexity Analysis:
  An analysis of the time and space complexity of the solution, providing insights into its efficiency and scalability.

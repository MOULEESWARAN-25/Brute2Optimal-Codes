## Optimized Approach for Minimum Number of Swaps to Make String Balanced

### Intuition
The problem requires us to make a string balanced, meaning every opening bracket `[` should be matched with a closing bracket `]`. The string contains an equal number of opening and closing brackets.

The approach leverages a stack to track unmatched brackets. Each swap can fix two unmatched brackets. The goal is to calculate the minimum number of swaps needed to balance the entire string.

### Approach
1. **Initialization:** 
   - Initialize a stack to keep track of unmatched brackets and a variable `a` to count the unmatched brackets.
   
2. **Traverse the String:** 
   - Loop through each character in the input string:
     - If the current bracket can form a valid pair (i.e., `[` followed by `]`), remove the matched pair from the stack.
     - If it does not match, push it onto the stack.
   
3. **Count Unmatched Brackets:** 
   - After processing the string, the variable `a` holds the number of unmatched brackets.

4. **Calculate Swaps:**
   - **Dividing by 4:** Each swap corrects 2 mismatched brackets. For every 4 unmatched brackets, we need 1 swap. Thus, if `a % 4 == 0`, return `a / 4`.
   - **Handling Leftovers:** If leftover unmatched brackets remain, add 1 to account for the additional swap needed.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) – The algorithm traverses the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) – The stack requires space proportional to the length of the string to store unmatched brackets.

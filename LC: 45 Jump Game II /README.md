### **Understanding the Approach (For Beginners)**  

The goal is to find the **minimum number of jumps** required to reach the last index of the array, starting from the first index.  

We use a **greedy algorithm**, meaning we always try to make the best choice at each step to minimize the number of jumps.

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**  

1. **Start at index `0`**  
   - We begin at the first index (`left = 0`).  
   - We also maintain a `count` variable, which tracks the number of jumps we have taken.  

2. **Check if we can reach the last index directly**  
   - If `nums[left]` (the number of steps we can jump from index `left`) is large enough to directly reach the last index, we return `count`.  
   - This means that we can jump directly to the last index in one step.

3. **Find the best position to jump to**  
   - If we cannot reach the last index directly, we need to find the **best** next position to jump to.  
   - We check all possible jumps from `nums[left]` and pick the index that allows us to go the farthest in the future.  
   - This ensures that we minimize the number of jumps.

4. **Update the `left` pointer**  
   - Move `left` to the **best index** found in the previous step.  
   - Increase `count` by `1` since we have taken a jump.

5. **Repeat the process**  
   - Continue this process until we reach the last index.

### **Complexity Analysis**  

- **Time Complexity: \(O(n)\)**  
  - We iterate through the array once, making the solution efficient.  

- **Space Complexity: \(O(1)\)**  
  - We only use a few extra integer variables, so no additional space is required.

### **Why Does This Work?**  

The greedy approach works because at each step, we always make the best possible decision. Instead of making unnecessary jumps, we always move to the index that allows us to reach the end in the fewest jumps.

## Reversing Segments of a String in Chunks of k

### Intuition
The task is to reverse segments of a given string in chunks of size `k`. When the remaining characters at the end of the string are fewer than `k`, those characters are reversed. This ensures that every `2k` characters are processed together, where the first `k` characters in each segment are reversed.

### Approach
1. **Swap Function:** 
   - A function is defined to swap characters in the string between two indices without using any temporary variable.
   
2. **Iterating through the String:** 
   - We loop through the string in steps of `2k`.
   - For each segment:
     - If the remaining characters are fewer than `k`, reverse all the remaining characters.
     - If there are at least `k` characters, reverse only the first `k` characters of the segment.
   
3. **Index Management:** 
   - Move the index by `2k` to skip the already processed segment and repeat the process for the next segment.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) – The algorithm processes each character in the string once, leading to linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) – The algorithm performs in-place swaps, requiring no extra space proportional to the input size.
